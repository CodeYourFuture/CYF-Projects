## Business problem

At CodeYourFuture, we run lots and lots of meetings, often with people
who don't know each other well or at all. We begin our meetings with an
energiser - a game to get the group together. But because we have so
many meetings, it can get hard to think of all these energisers and it's
hard to know which are good.

## Proposed functionality

The app should present an energiser from a database of energisers

Energisers can be chosen by name, randomly selected, or sorted by some
metric

Users can vote on the energiser according to some metrics they find
useful (fun/quick/ideal number of participants etc)

All data should be stored in a database and be accessed by API

## Users and roles

As a **host** I want to pull up an energiser suitable for my meeting and
have a good description of how to run it

As an **attendee**, I want to upvote energisers I like and downvote the
ones I found a bit rubbish

As a **creator**, I want to upload my energisers in a simple structured
way

## Likely challenges

-   Be careful how you structure your data as this could get confusing
    quickly

## Stretch goals

-   **Create a slackbot**

    -   As a host I want to to run some energisers (eg voting or
        answers) on a slack post that is posted automatically by the app

-   **User Research**

    -   Speak to your classmates about what features they'd like to use.
        Select a sensible feature and build it.

    -   Speak to your teachers and mentors to see what features they'd
        like to use in the app. Select a sensible feature and build it.

-   **Dark mode**

    -   As any kind of user, I would like to access dark mode

-   **Host a game (mega stretch)**

    -   As any kind of user, I'd like to play simple games directly in
        the Energise app.
