Impact (Data)

## Business problem

At CodeYourFuture, we use data to understand the impact of everything we
do. We spend a lot of time diving into our data and tracing outcomes,
and we use charts, graphs, and quantified impact statements in our pitch
decks, grant applications, and regulated reporting.

But this is a ton of work; we repeat ourselves a lot, and we don\'t have
a branded, organised way to explain these insights to others, including
showing our working out and how we came to make these statements.

How can we **explore**, **explain**, **store** and **share** these
insights in an organised way?

What is the **simplest thing** that can possibly work?

### Proposed functionality

- A way to **pull** anonymised data from multiple sources

  - We have the live data feed

  - What other data sources do we use a lot?

- A way to **interrogate** data for the common questions we ask

  - Are there existing products we can use for this? What is
    simplest?

- A way to **visualise** data for the common questions we ask

  - Are there existing products we can use for this? What is
    simplest?

- A way to **share** impact data

  - Can we export CYF branded graphs and visuals?

  - Can we embed impact statements on Google Slides or websites?

This application could be full stack or front end. It is data focused.
The front end must score 100 for Accessibility on Lighthouse.

## Users and roles

As a CYF grant writer, I want to make clear, fact-based statements about
our impact..

As a grant maker, I want to see the methodology for impact statements so
I can verify them.

As a CYF data contributor (trainees and alum), I want to know that my
data is being used correctly to support CYF\'s work and future trainees.

As a CYF member, I want to be able to talk about CYF\'s work with strong
facts I can find and share easily.

As a regulator, I want to make sure Personally Identifying Information
is not shared and all data is anonymised before store.

## Stretch goals

**Admin view**

- This product uses open data sets. CYF also has some private data
  sets, which cannot be connected publicly. What would you need to do
  to make this application secure for this data? Is it wise to do
  this? What are the implications?

**User Research**

- Speak to staff about how they use data to help support CYF and what
  kinds of impact statements would help them most.

## Things to Consider

Don\'t get overcomplicated. Start with a single data point comparison
between two data sources. Use existing products to help you. Identify
and build the missing piece for _this_ use case.
