Badger Badger (DevOps)

## Business problem

At Code Your Future we have a bunch of great Open Source products, but
they\'re not all in the greatest shape they could be. To really shine,
our FOSS repos should meet the highest standards of
[https://www.bestpractices.dev](https://www.bestpractices.dev)\
\
But to do this, we need a team of developers to **understand** the
criteria, **plan** the changes, **drive** the adoption, and **support**
all technical contributors to meet the new standards.

This highly challenging project is only suitable for advanced trainees
or grads doing a specialisation track.

## Proposed functionality

At least one CYF FOSS project should meet the requirements for a passing
level Badge\

## Users and roles

As a FOSS maintainer I want my project to be well-run and of good
quality

As a CYF organiser, I want to attract talented developers to volunteer
with us

As a CYF trainee, grad, or volunteer I want to contribute to impressive
codebases and raise my profile

As a CYF DevOps track trainee, I want to gain practical experience in
creating a culture of excellence in an organisation

As the Director of Education, I want to share our work and have properly
represent the talents and achievements of our community

## Likely challenges

There are over 600 repos in CYF, and you can\'t do them all. I suggest
you start small. **Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.**

## Stretch goals

Silver, or Gold!
