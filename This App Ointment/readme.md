# This App Ointment

## Business problem

Outside of London, trains don\'t really work. It makes it really
difficult to plan meetups as everyone is delayed all the time, sometimes
for hours. It would be great to identify the most reliable place and
time to meet for most people, based on _actual_ train times not
timetables.

How can we plot a meeting point between a group of people that is more
reliable and minimises the chance of intolerable disruption,
disappointment, and delay?

This project is all about data and insights. Be very very careful about
your scope.

What is the **simplest** thing that could possibly work?

## Proposed functionality

A way to **enter** locations

A way to **join** a meeting group

A way to **identify** an optimised location

A way to **share** the identified meeting location

A way to **access** everything on a phone (in transit)

## Users and roles

As a **community member**, I want to look forward to in-person meetings
instead of dreading them

As a **community organiser**, I want to arrange meetups people show up
for!

As a **tired and old person**, I want to spend less time freezing on the
platform at Manchester Victoria

## Stretch goals

- Considering setting further parameters like:

- Maximum time each person is able to spend travelling

- Maximum price each person is able to spend on tickets

- Save favourite locations to groups

- Help users recommend places around train and bus stations that can
  host CYF groups (this could be an integration with Maps)

## Things to consider

- Some people may not be able to share or publish their location; how
  will you protect privacy?

- **There is an incredible website called Recent Train Times; what can
  you learn from it?

- Can you use the Google Distance Matrix API to help you?
