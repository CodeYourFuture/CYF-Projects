Development Planner

## Business problem

At CodeYourFuture, we work through a defined syllabus and our coursework
is set by teachers and subject matter experts.

After we graduate, we need to take control of our professional
development and plan our own learning schedule.

## Proposed functionality

The app should have user accounts and all plans should default to
private

Users can invite feedback on their private plans with a share link

Goals can be scheduled and tasks prompted by a notification system

All data should be stored in a database and be accessed by API

## Users and roles

**[As a graduate, I want to create a professional development plan with
defined and scheduled SMART goals.]{.mark}**

**[As a job applicant, I want to create a role focused development plan
to prepare for a specific job opportunity.]{.mark}**

**[As a mentor, I want to be able to give feedback based on my
professional expertise.]{.mark}**

## Likely challenges

- Be careful how you structure your data as this could get confusing
  quickly

- How will you send out notifications? With a mailer, or push
  notifications?

- How will you authenticate? Can you use Github? Should you use
  Google?

## Existing Systems

## Stretch goals

- **Allow role plans to be published and remixed after they have been
  developed**

  - As a graduate, I want to share the effective development plan
    that helped me get a job

  - As a mentor, I want to improve a template development plan in my
    specialism

  - As an applicant, I want a framework to begin my own plan
