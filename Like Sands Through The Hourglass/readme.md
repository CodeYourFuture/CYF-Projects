## Business problem

At Code Your Future, we try to save money as much as possible, so we can
do the most with our limited funds. But sometimes it\'s hard to perceive
the costs of our decisions and allocate our resources wisely.. For
example, if five people spend one hour deciding whether to buy one
software licence, it might actually be cheaper just to buy the software
instead of having the meeting.

How can we better understand the value of our time? How can we help each
other to not waste precious resources that could go towards trainee
expenses or infrastructure improvements.

What is the **simplest** thing that could possibly work?

## Proposed functionality

**Poll salaries**

Privately poll each meeting attendee for their annual salary

_Do not permanently store or visually display this personal information_

**Calculate cost**

Combine the salaries and compute the cost per second of the combined
time of the attendees

**Display cost clock**

Display a cost per second ticking up in the Google Meet call

## Users and roles

**As a staff member**, I want to visualise the cost of discussing
resource allocation

**As a donor,** I want to know CYF rigorously examines its own use of
funds

## Stretch goals

- Can this extension integrate with Google Calendar and project the
  cost of proposed future meetings as well?

- It costs a company much more than the annual salary to employ
  someone; can you include those costs as well? Or a rough percentage?

- Could an attendee also input the cost of the resource being
  discussed, if any, so if the cost of the meeting surpasses the cost
  of the resource, the attendees are notified?

## Things to consider

If there are only two people in the meeting, each party can deduce the
annual salary of the other. Is this a problem? How will you tackle this?
Can CYF provide a blended employee cost per second default value that is
used instead in this scenario?

is a longstanding website that does a basic version of this idea. What
can you learn from it?

Agencies and contractors [[must calculate their

in this way to understand how much to bid for work. What can you learn
from applications like

and what is \"overkill\" for your product?
