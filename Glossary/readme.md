## Business problem

We introduce a lot of new concepts and technical "nomenclature" to
students during the CYF course. It can be hard to keep track of all of
the different terms that get used, sometimes with different meanings in
different contexts. You can search for a word within the syllabus, but
the output isn't formatted and it can be hard to figure out which
reference to that word will actually give a good definition.

## Proposed functionality

A solution would provide an easy-to-use way to search for a technical
term and get a short definition, along with links to additional
resources (e.g. appropriate section in the syllabus, MDN, ...) and
related terms.

## Users and roles

The primary users will be students looking for a definition for a
specific term. There will also be students and mentors adding content,
either new terms or new/updated material for existing terms. There may
also be some kind of moderation/administrative role (see below).

## Likely challenges

How can we moderate and review the definitions as they're added, to
ensure that they're high quality and easily understood by students? How
do we handle common misspellings, or searching for things by symbols?

There can end up being a lot of data in a system like this, how can we
create a system that scales efficiently to deal with that (e.g. showing
"pages" of data)?

## Stretch goals

- **Slack bot**: that people can ask for definitions, and will reply
  with a snippet and link

- **History**: can we see how the definitions have been changed over
  time, and by whom?

- **Syllabus integration**: can we get the definition information from
  the syllabus somehow?
